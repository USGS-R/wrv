# Unprocessed Data

The *unprocessed* descriptor for data residing in this folder is a relative term;
processing occurs in stages, and the "processed data" from one stage may be considered the "unprocessed data" of the next ([credit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data)).
Many of these datasets are composed entirely of data collected from the study site;
however, a few of the datasets are the result of a preliminary stage of data processing.
For example, evapotranspiration and precipitation datasets are the result of processing that is not explicitly shown in the **wrv** package.
