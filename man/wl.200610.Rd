\title{Groundwater-Level Contours for October 2006}
\format{An object of SpatialLinesDataFrame class containing 265 Lines and a
  data.frame with the following variables:
  \describe{
    \item{CONTOUR}{groundwater elevation contour value in meters above the
      North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88).}
    \item{certainty}{certainty of the groundwater-level contour based on
      data position and density, specified as \code{"good"} or \code{"poor"}.}
  }
  Geographic coordinates are in units of meters, in conformance with the
  North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83), and placed in the
  Idaho Transverse Mercator projection (\href{https://www.idwr.idaho.gov/GIS/IDTM/}{IDTM}).}

This dataset is from Plate 1 in Skinner and others (2007), and available on the

\usage{

\description{
Groundwater-level contours with a 20 foot (6.096 meter) contour interval for the
unconfined aquifer in the Wood River Valley, south-central Idaho,
representing conditions during October 2006.
