      }
     Volumetric flow rates are calculated for their respective area in
     the irrigation entity---not just that part overlying the model area.
     Flow rate values are given this way in order to facilitate with quality assurance of
     the water-budget calculation.
     To calculate a simulated volumetric-flow rate: divide the flow rate by the affected area,
     and then multiply this value by the area of the irrigation entity that is located in
     the model domain (\code{area.model}).

  (5) Well pumping data are also stored in \code{pumping.rech} (see \code{pod.rech} component),
      an object of data.frame class with the following components:
      \describe{
        \item{WMISNumber}{unique number assigned to a water right point of diversion.}
        \item{YearMonth}{calendar year and month YYYYMM.}
        \item{Pumping}{volumetric rate of pumping, in cubic meters per month.}
      }
}
\description{
This function estimates natural and incidental groundwater recharge at the water table,
and pumping demand at production wells.
A water-balance approach is used to calculate these volumetric flow rate estimates,
where positive values are flow into the aqufer system (groundwater recharge),
and negative values are flow out of the system (groundwater discharge).
