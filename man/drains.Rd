\title{Drain Boundaries at Stanton Crossing and Silver Creek}
\format{An object of SpatialPolygonsDataFrame class containing a set of 2 Polygons and
  a data.frame with the following variable:
  \describe{
    \item{Name}{identifier for the polygon.}
    \item{cond}{drain conductance in square meters per day.}
    \item{elev}{drain threshold elevation in meters above the
      North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88).}
  }
  Geographic coordinates are in units of meters, in conformance with the
  North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83), and placed in the
  Idaho Transverse Mercator projection (\href{https://www.idwr.idaho.gov/GIS/IDTM/}{IDTM}).}

drains

\description{
Polygons used to define the locations of drain boundaries in the model domain.
The polygons clip the line segments along the aquifer boundary (see \code{\link{alluvium.extent}}),
and model cells intersecting these clipped-line segments are defined as boundary cells.
