\format{An object of SpatialPolygonsDataFrame class containing 3 Polygons and a
  data.frame with the following variables:
  \describe{
    \item{ID}{numeric identifier assigned to the polygon.}
    \item{PrecipZone}{name of the precipitation zone:
      \dQuote{Ketchum}, the northernmost zone with data from the
        Ketchum National Weather Service coop weather station.
      \dQuote{Hailey}, central zone with data from the
        Hailey 3NNW National Weather Service coop weather station.
      \dQuote{Picabo}, southernmost zone with data from the
        Picabo AgriMet weather station.}

  Geographic coordinates are in units of meters, in conformance with the
