\title{Tributary Basin Underflow}
\format{An object of SpatialPolygonsDataFrame class containing a set of 22 Polygons and a
  data.frame with the following variable:
  \describe{
    \item{Name}{tributary name}
    \item{MinLSD}{minimum land-surface datum (elevation) along the transect,
      in meters above the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88).}
    \item{BdrkDepth}{mean saturated thickness along the transect line, in meters;
      estimated as the distance between the estimated water table and bedrock elevations.}
    \item{TribWidth}{width of the tributary canyon, or length of the transect line, in meters.}
    \item{LandGrad}{land surface elevation gradient perpendicular to the
      cross-sectional transect line, a dimensionless quantity.}
    \item{K}{hydraulic conductivity in meters per day.}
    \item{SatArea}{estimated saturated cross-sectional area, in square meters;
      its geometry is represented as the lower-half of an ellipse with
      width and height equal to \code{TribWidth} and \code{BdrkDepth}, respectively.}
    \item{DarcyFlow}{groundwater flow rate, in cubic meters per day, calculated using a
      \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_law}{Darcian} analysis.}
    \item{BasinArea}{land-surface area defined by the basin above the cross-sectional transect line.}
    \item{BasinAreaType}{label that describes the relative basin size; where
      \code{"big"} indicates a basin area greater than 10 square miles (25.9 square kilometers), and
      \code{"small"} indicates a basin area that is less than this breakpoint value.}
    \item{PrecipRate}{mean precipitation rate within the basin area, in meters per day.}
    \item{PrecipFlow}{mean precipitation flow rate, in cubic meters per day,
      calculated by multiplying \code{PrecipRate} by \code{BasinArea}.}
    \item{FlowRatio}{ratio of darcy flow rate to precipitation flow rate,
      or \code{DarcyFlow} divided by \code{PrecipFlow}, a dimensionless quantity.}
    \item{Flow}{estimated average volumetric flow rate, in cubic meters per day.}

  Geographic coordinates are in units of meters, in conformance with the
  North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83), and placed in the
  Idaho Transverse Mercator projection (\href{https://www.idwr.idaho.gov/GIS/IDTM/}{IDTM}).}

U.S. Geological Survey, accessed on July 2, 2015;
  a Keyhole Markup Language (\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kml}{KML}) file created in
  \href{http://www.google.com/earth/}{Google Earth} with polygons drawn by hand in
  areas of known specified flow boundaries.
  Transect lines are defined by the polygon boundaries within the extent of
  alluvium aquifer (see \code{\link{alluvium.extent}} dataset).
  The land surface gradient (\code{LandGrad}) was estimated from the
  \code{\link{land.surface}} dataset.
  Hydraulic conductivity (\code{K}) is the average of two geometric means of hydraulic conductivity
  in the unconfined aquifer taken from table 2 in Bartolino and Adkins (2012).
  The U.S. Geologic Survey \href{http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/}{StreamStats} tool
  (Ries and others, 2004) was used to delineate the basin area (\code{BasinArea}) and
  estimate the precipitation rate (\code{PrecipRate}).
  See the appendix C. Package Dataset Creation for the \R code used to calculate the
  flow estimates (\code{Flow}).
