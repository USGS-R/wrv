[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/USGS-R/wrv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/USGS-R/wrv)

## Overview

The [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package **wrv** is for processing the
groundwater-flow model of the Wood River Valley (WRV) aquifer system, south-central Idaho.
The groundwater-flow model is described in the associated
[model report](https://dx.doi.org/10.3133/sir20165080 "USGS Scientific Investigations Report") and
[model archive](https://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7C827DT "USGS Data Release").
Included in the package is [MODFLOW-USG](https://water.usgs.gov/ogw/mfusg/ "MODFLOW-USG") version 1.3,
a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) computer code that solves the groundwater-flow equation.

## Install

You can install the stable version of **wrv** from [GRAN](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/gran.html),
and its dependencies from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), using the following commands:

```r
repos <- c("https://owi.usgs.gov/R", "https://cloud.r-project.org/")
update.packages(ask = FALSE, repos = repos)
install.packages("wrv", repos = repos, dependencies = TRUE)
```

Or use **devtools** to install the development version from GitHub.

```r
