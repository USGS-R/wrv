# wrv

An [R](http://www.r-project.org/ "The R Project for Statistical Computing") package for processing the groundwater-flow model of the Wood River Valley (WRV) aquifer system, south-central Idaho.
The groundwater-flow model is described in the associated [model report](http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/sir20165080 "USGS Scientific Investigations Report") and
[model archive](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/577507c1e4b07dd077c70746 "USGS Data Release").
Included in the package is [MODFLOW-USG](http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/mfusg/ "MODFLOW-USG") version 1.2, a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) computer code that solves the groundwater-flow equation.
The set of standards used for coding the **wrv** package is documented in [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml "Google's R Style Guide").

## Install

If R is not already installed on your computer, download and install the latest binary distribution from the Comprehensive R Archive Network
([CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/ "The Comprehensive R Archive Network")).
Next, open an R session and install user-contributed R packages from CRAN and the Geological Survey R Archive Network
([GRAN](http://owi.usgs.gov/R/gran.html "The Geological Survey R Archive Network")) using the following commands:

```r
repos <- c("http://owi.usgs.gov/R", getOption("repos"))
update.packages(ask = FALSE, repos = repos)
install.packages("wrv", repos = repos, dependencies = TRUE, type = "both")
```

## Run

Load the **wrv** package in the current R session:

```r
library(wrv)
```

Access package documentation:

```r
help(package = "wrv")
```
